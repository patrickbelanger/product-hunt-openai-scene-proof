# SceneProof Status

Last updated: 2026-09-12
Current branch: `feat/p0-media-ingestion`
Current milestone: PR1 implemented and locally verified; ready for review.

Targeted pre-merge correction verified: remove the major-brand allowlist while
retaining the `ftyp` signature gate and requiring FFprobe MP4/QuickTime format,
H.264 and all existing video limits. Real `iso6` H.264 MP4 imports successfully;
a corrupt `ftyp`-only file still fails. Architecture and PR1 scope are unchanged.

## Recovery and working state

PR0 merge verified at `fefb7db` on origin/main after fetch. The initial worktree
was clean on feat/p0-foundation. Local main was fast-forwarded and PR1 branched
from that merge. Existing components and historical context were preserved.
Correction recovery found a clean worktree at `b373b20`, tracking
`origin/feat/p0-media-ingestion`; the PR1 baseline is now committed.

Project creation/rules/reload remain working. PR1 adds JPEG/PNG and bounded
MP4/H.264 upload, local MediaStorage, controlled FFprobe/FFmpeg scene/fallback
sampling, durable ordered shots/frames, normalized PNG delivery scoped by project,
and failed import history. React supports import, real pending/error/retry states,
frame selection and reload. No Astra calls, findings or demo are implemented.

## Verification

- Gradle build: passed, 13 backend tests (4 foundation + 9 media), zero failed/skipped,
  real PostgreSQL 17.9 and FFmpeg/ImageIO. V2 applied successfully to test and local DB.
- Frontend: 6 Vitest/RTL tests passed; TypeScript and Vite production build passed.
- OpenAPI generation drift check: passed.
- Chromium (previous PR1 verification, not rerun for this backend correction):
  3 E2E tests passed against the fresh packaged API, including actual PNG
  load, multipart contract, project scoping, reload and persistent failure history.
- Desktop/tablet screenshots inspected; no horizontal overflow.
- git diff --check: passed. Remote CI status has not been checked in this session.

An early test failure came from unflushed JPA fixtures in enclosing test transactions;
fixtures now flush before JDBC reads. Browser execution required access outside the
sandbox to the installed Chromium cache. Skipped/failed initial attempts are not
counted as passing verification.

## Running

README contains setup and limits; set Java 25 and an absolute MEDIA_ROOT. PostgreSQL
is running on 55432. Existing user IDE API/Vite on 8085/5173 were preserved.
Verification uses the freshly built API on 8086 with repository .local/media and
Playwright-managed Vite on 5174 (API_PROXY_TARGET + E2E_WEB_PORT overrides).
Restart the IDE API to load PR1 classes before testing on the default ports.
No API key is needed. FFmpeg/FFprobe must be on PATH for video and backend tests.

## Known limits / blockers

No local PR1 blocker. Synchronous imports allow one active operation per process,
32 frames per video, 100 attempts per project. No automatic orphan collector:
abrupt process termination may leave unreferenced files. Normal failures clean
their directories; database failure may prevent recording failed history.
No deletion/reorder API, EXIF rotation or advanced video color management in PR1.

Public hosting, durable media, anonymous isolation and paid-demo budget remain
pending material decisions before deployment. The app stays local/unauthenticated.
Tests leave clearly named browser verification projects/media in local storage.
See ADR-0003 and MEDIA-PIPELINE for precise boundaries.

## Next

Review the targeted correction on this branch; this correction is not committed,
pushed or merged by the agent.
After integration, create `feat/p0-astra-analysis`: establish real model access
with a small original fixture, verify transport/schema, persist real usage/failures.
September 18 target and planned branch order remain unchanged.
